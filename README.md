# Terrain-Interaction-Toolkit
A toolkit made for making details and trees on existing Unity terrains interactable. Includes STP integration.
Transform existing terrain details into GameObject from the editor or create placeholders at runtime and the existing details will be removed as you interact with them.
This code is meant to make changes to your terrain. It is highly recommended that you know what you're doing.
Back up your terrains. Use at your own risk.
